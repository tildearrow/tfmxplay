# tfmxplay

not to be confused with [another player with the same name](http://www.boomerangsworld.de/cms/patches/tfmxplay.html).

this is my own clean-room design TFMX player.

the difference between this player and the other ones is that no reverse engineering, obfuscated code, assembly source or emulation is involved; instead relying upon existing documentation, guesswork and ABX tests for most of it. hence "clean-room design".

the player strives to meet Turrican 2 standards.
