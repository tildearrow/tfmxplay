# to-do

- accurate dual vibratos
- fix the wall again
  - broken AddBegin timing...
  - the keys sound too short (late AddBegin fixes this)
  - but the dragon needs short
  - the bass envelope is not proper (noticeable during the solo). I must be doing something wrong.
- fix world 5
  - the kick erm heartbeat has a different pitch
    - implementing detune may solve it
  - the wind has a wrong pitch. i am not even sure how is this done
  - to be checked in the official TFMX editor
- 7-voice playback
- tempo
- song fading
- lots of other things
